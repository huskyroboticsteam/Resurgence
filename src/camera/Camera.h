   Cameras can be defined in YAML files (see @ref cameraconfig) and opened using
   these files at runtime (see Camera::openFromConfigFile()).

/**
	@brief Represents a camera on the rover, from which a video feed can be
	retrieved.

	The Camera class provides an interface for opening a camera attached to the
	rover, and retrieving frames from it. Additionally, a Camera object contains
	other information associated with the camera, such as a description, its
	location on the rover, and its intrinsic camera parameters.

	A Camera object provides concurrent access to the camera; that is, the
	video feed will be updated in a separate thread and a client may retrieve a
	frame at any time. To avoid getting duplicate frames, there is a concept of
	a "frame number"; it will be returned upon retrieving a frame, and may be
	used to check if the current frame held by the Camera is different from the
	last one the client retrieved. The frame number will be different if two
	frames (within a reasonable time interval) are different.

	Additionally, if copied, Camera objects share ownership over a camera; when
	the last Camera object is destroyed, the underlying camera will be
	closed. This means multiple Camera objects may exist at different places in
	the code that refer to the same underlying camera and share access to it.

	@warning Note that intrinsic and extrinsic parameters are optional for a
	Camera object; Camera objects that are missing either intrinsic parameters,
	extrinsic parameters, or both may not be suitable for some computer vision
	operations. For example, AR tag detection requires intrinsic parameters and
	cannot be performed without them. Use Camera::hasIntrinsicParams() and
	Camera::hasExtrinsicParams() to check for the presence of each.
