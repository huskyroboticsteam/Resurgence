/**
   This is the required "main" file for Catch2. Nothing needs to be in this file except for the
   two preprocessor directives above. The preprocessor will fill in a main function and all the
   stuff Catch2 needs at compile time.

   Tests should instead go in files that are in team subdirectories and added to the
   CMakeLists.txt.
